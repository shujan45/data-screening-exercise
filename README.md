This repository consistd of code done in R language for Tidying and Visualizing an Immigration Detention Dataset.
In order to better understanding of the exercise, I have done different part of tasks in different R files like one file name A.Data Cleaning has data cleaning related code only, in similar way B.Analysis has task and code used to analyse the dataset and find top 10 detention dacilities and same goes for C.Visualize where code related to visualization is written.
For the better understanding and easiness I have another file where I have completed all the tasks mentioned in the exercise at one place which can be found in file named "Tidying and Visualizing an Immigration Detention Dataset".


Let's breakdown each exercise.
While doing cleaning the tasks was to get rid of unwanted characters from the dataset, deal with the blank and n/a space in the dataset and change the misformed date into formal formate. All this was done by applying various methodology which can be found in the file itself for better convenience.
While analysing the date, similar approach was taken where important steps are mentioned in the file.
After visualization, output has been saved in Top_Ten_Facilities_Population.png which can be found in this repository.

If you wish to go through separate file for separate tasks you can do that as well or else you can go through all the exercise in Immigration_Detention_Data_Analysis_Visualization(All Code in One File).ipynb.
